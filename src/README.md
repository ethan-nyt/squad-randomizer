# Super-Duper Squad Shuffler

## What is it?
A single-page application designed to help the NYTimes Care-Platforms team divide into randomly assigned squads during sprint planning.

## Where can I try it?
[On Heroku](http://supershuffle.herokuapp.com)

## Feature Requests
1. after shuffling, move specific names from one group to another (drag/drop?)
2. integrate with slack API to share lists directly in #care-platforms
3. Allow user to input squad names
4. Designate certain participants as FRM and ensure that two FRM's are not shuffled into the same squad.
5. Add pictures or avatars for each squad participant

## Setup
`npm install` (in root project directory)

## Run
`npm start // app will run on localhost:3000` (in root project directory)
